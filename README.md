Python-based Object Oriented Programming(OOP)to build Graphical User Interface (GUI) confers some popular image processing techniques. An image can be chosen by the user and can apply different filters(Blurring, Low pass, high Pass, Band Pass, Sobel, Prewitt, etc) to the selected image. User can choose the range of applicable parameters for different filters which will be employed to the images. The image selected by the user should be equal to or less than the pixel dimension 512*512.
